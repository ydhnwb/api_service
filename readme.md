## Setup repo

### Branching

Since this might be me alone, well please use the issue ID of github project as branch when develop its task, check url address bar for it. To get `issue id` is to convert backlog to issue on project board. Example issue id is 1230, well then do this:

- git checkout main
- git pull origin main
- git checkout -b "#1230"
- start working
- push your change using git push origin '#1230'

There are more branching strategy with pool but I don't want to talk about it right now

### Dependencies

Most dependencies that needed inside this repo is available on go.mod.  
You can install it using this command:

```
go get
```

and

```
go mod install
```

### Configure hot reload

I am using AIR to make it hot reload when developing. If you are using linux, please take a look at `.air.toml` file and change some parameters there.

To use it for developing, instead running it using `go run main.go`, replace it with this command:

```
air
```

### Migration tool

I am using https://github.com/golang-migrate/ package.
You can install it using the command:

```
go install -tags 'postgres' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate
```

after success, try to run it with `migrate` and then enter. It should show all the commands
of using this migrate cli tool. Please refer to this article `https://medium.com/@aldinofrizal/golang-migrate-8990135cdc6`

### How I add migration?

Here is the cli command template:

```
migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations create_table_users_and_devices
```

`migrate` is cli-app we installed. `create` means we will create a migration, it should create at leats two type of file (UP and DOWN), `-ext` is extension, we use postgresql so it will be sql (If you use mongodb, it migth be `json`). `-dir` is where we want to generate the migration file, please put it under `migrations` folder AND DO NOT CHANGE IT!. `create-table-users` is a name what migration we gonna do, we do not have convention for that so please take a look at previous data.

## Up the migration

The url for database can be variative, but for now, since I don't use containerized thing like docker, so this is the db url and change it with your local environment:

```
postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname?YOUR_QUERY_OPTIONAL
```

example of url database: `postgres://postgres:yudhanewbie@localhost:5432/api_service?sslmode=disable`

and run this command

```
migrate -database "YOU_URL_TO_DATABASE" -path migrations up
```

### How do I cancel the migration?

```
migrate -database "YOU_URL_TO_DATABASE" -path migrations down
```

### BuildResponseError

Here is the rule of it:

- if the error come from validator/v10 (gin), useErrorID is `true`
- if it come from others / manual, useErrorID should be false
- not all error response need to be translated, some of them are from repo/db query

## Personal target

- Please and please and please don't use GORM or any other ORM :v
- maintain the singleton of the db instance. (Leads too much database connection)
- easy, readable error response
- use HTTP status code as main source of truth rather than other field like 'status' etc
- less magic is better

## Mandatory guide.

- test coverage at least 80%
